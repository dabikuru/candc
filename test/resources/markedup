# This is the 'markedup' file which maps from bare categories to the
# categories marked up with head and dependency information.  This
# file now also contains the mapping to grammatical relations based
# on the Briscoe and Carroll scheme.
#
# Editing existing marked up categories in this file without regenerating
# the training data and reestimating the model will lead to reduced
# performance.  However, it is possible to change the mapping to grammatical
# relations without affecting the existing model.
#
# The category information is in the following format:
# <frequency> <bare_category>
#   <#_of_slots> <markedup_category>
#   [! <markedup_category>]
#   <slot_1> <gr_1>
#   <slot_2> <gr_2>
# ...
#
# The exclamation marked entry is an alternative markedup category
# with a different head passing scheme to match Briscoe and Carroll.
#
# The slots in the CCG markup aren't always numbered from left to right (for
# historical reasons). This is an inconsistency we will fix in a later version.
#
# The gr annotation is based on the Briscoe and Carroll (B+C) GR scheme.

#
# Some things to fix:
#
# the subject in (S[adj]\NP)/NP gets ignored, which is correct except when the dependency has
# come about through a unary rule. So we're currently not producing this unary rule dependency.
# (There may be other cases like this.)
#
# The GR markup for the question categories at the end of the file needs looking at again
#
# The CCG dependencies haven't been changed, even where there are obvious improvements,
# because this version of the markedup file was used to get the CL-paper results and
# we'd like this to serve as part of the record of those results.
